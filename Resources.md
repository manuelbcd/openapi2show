## Brief information

### What is OpenApi?
OpenApi Specification (OAS), originally known as SWAGGER, is an specification aimed to describe APIs via files that can be consumed and 
produced by machines. It is driven by OpenApi Initiative.

Just as REST is now the new SOAP, OpenAPI is not the new WSDL. The main difference is its capacity for design-first development with a 
wide range of tooling and cross-platform support.

OpenAPI Spec. offers a declarative contract that defines the strucure of API requests and responses so that clients can understand and consume
services agnostically without the need of accessing source code.

Nowadays is the most broadly adopted industry standard for describing new AIPs.

### Advantages
- The most developer tooling ecosystem.
- Description validation and linting
- Data validation (in development and deployment time)
- Documentation generation (human readable and machine-readable, automatically and always up-to-date)
- Code generation (both server and client in almost any programming language)
- Graphical editors (Allow easy creation of description files using GUI)
- Mock servers (perfect for fast and automatic testing)
- Security analysis (discover possible vulnerabilities at design stage instead of DEV-PROD)


### History

In 2009, Tony Tam from Wordnik (an online dictionary) started to work on what would become the Swagger Specification, used to describe Wordnik's 
JSON API (He named it SWAGR joking about WADL, the XML standard for defining APIs).

In March 2015, SmartBear Software acquired intellectual property and open-source project.  SmartBear donated Swagger Spec. to OpenAPI initiative,
a new organisation from Linux Foundation.  Founding members of this OpenAPI initiative were: Microsoft, Google, IBM, Paypal, Apigee, 3Scale, 
CapitalOne, Intuit, Restlet and SmartBear (later joined MuleSoft).


The OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on 
how APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting 
a vendor neutral description format. The OpenAPI Specification was originally based on the Swagger Specification, donated by SmartBear Software.
